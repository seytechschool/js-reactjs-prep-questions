        <h4>JavaScript Questions - Concepts</h4>

        <h3>What is functional programming?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Functional Programming produces programs by composing mathematical
          functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.
          <pre><code>Terms: Pure functions, Avoid side-effects, higher order functions</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in
          JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function
          calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on
          long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.<br />
          Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop.
          <br />When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and
          the code keeps running without blocking for the result. <br />When the
          response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event
          handler to be run, where the control flow continues.<br />
          In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent
          operations.<br />
          <pre><code>Terms: top-to-bottom, blocking, event loop</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to
          determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>typeof [] also an object. typeof null also an object</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is
          equal to NaN?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
            NaN === NaN // ? why?
            isNaN();
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          How to you explain closure?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Closures is simply the ability of a function at the time of
          declaration to remember the references of variables and parameters on
          its current scope, on its parent function scope, on its parent's
          parent function scope until it reaches the global scope with the help
          of Scope Chain. Basically it is the Scope created when the function
          was declared. <br />
          Examples are a great way to explain closures.
          <pre><code>
            var globalVar = "global";
            var outerVar = "outer"

            function outerFunc(outerParam) {
              function innerFunc(innerParam) {
                console.log(globalVar, outerParam, innerParam);
              }
              return innerFunc;
            }

            const x = outerFunc(outerVar);
            outerVar = "outer-2";
            globalVar = "guess"
            x("inner");
          </code></pre>
          This will print "guess outer inner". The explanation for this is that
          when we invoke the outerFunc function and assigned the returned value
          the innerFunc function to the variable x, the outerParam will have a
          value of outer even though we assign a new value outer-2 to the
          outerVar variable because the reassignment happened after the
          invocation of the outer function and in that time when we invoke the
          outerFunc function it's look up the value of outerVar in the Scope
          Chain, the outerVar will have a value of "outer".<br />
          Now, when we invoke the x variable which have a reference to the
          innerFunc, the innerParam will have a value of inner because thats the
          value we pass in the invocation and the globalVar variable will have a
          value of guess because before the invocation of the x variable we
          assign a new value to the globalVar and at the time of invocation x
          the value of globalVar in the_Scope Chain_ is guess.
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is debounce?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Debouncing a function ensures that it doesn’t get called too
          frequently. Usually we don't write a custom debounce function and use
          the "lodash" version, which is great Example

            href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-debouncing-in-javascript"

        </div>

        <h3>
          The data types supported by JavaScript are?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
            Undefined
            Null
            Boolean
            String
            Symbol
            Number
            Object
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          Explain var, let, const?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or
          const.
          <pre><code>
            var a=10;
            let b=20;
            const PI=3.14;
          </code></pre>
          <i>var:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is
          limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined
          outside any function, the scope of the variable is global. var is
          “function scoped”.<br />
          <i>let:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or
          “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
          “let” and “const” are“block scoped”.<br />
          <i>const:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const”
          is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable
          is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned. “const” cannot
          be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          === and !== are strict comparison operators: <br />

          JavaScript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison.
          For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type
          and:<br />

          Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of
          characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding
          positions.<br />
          Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have
          the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
          Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.<br />
          Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are
          false.<br />
          Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.<br />
          Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined)
          is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]<br />
          Example:
          <pre><code>
            0 == false   // true
            0 === false  // false, because they are of a different type
            1 == "1"     // true, automatic type conversion for value only
            1 === "1"    // false, because they are of a different type
            null == undefined // true
            null === undefined // false
            '0' == false // true
            '0' === false // false
          </code></pre>
