        <h3>What is functional programming?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Functional Programming produces programs by composing mathematical
          functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.
          <pre><code>Terms: Pure functions, Avoid side-effects, higher order functions</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in
          JavaScript?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function
          calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on
          long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.<br />
          Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop.
          <br />When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and
          the code keeps running without blocking for the result. <br />When the
          response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event
          handler to be run, where the control flow continues.<br />
          In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent
          operations.<br />
          <pre><code>Terms: top-to-bottom, blocking, event loop</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to
          determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>typeof [] also an object. typeof null also an object</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is
          equal to NaN?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
            NaN === NaN // ? why?
            isNaN();
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          How to you explain closure?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Closures is simply the ability of a function at the time of
          declaration to remember the references of variables and parameters on
          its current scope, on its parent function scope, on its parent's
          parent function scope until it reaches the global scope with the help
          of Scope Chain. Basically it is the Scope created when the function
          was declared. <br />
          Examples are a great way to explain closures.
          <pre><code>
            var globalVar = "global";
            var outerVar = "outer"

            function outerFunc(outerParam) {
              function innerFunc(innerParam) {
                console.log(globalVar, outerParam, innerParam);
              }
              return innerFunc;
            }

            const x = outerFunc(outerVar);
            outerVar = "outer-2";
            globalVar = "guess"
            x("inner");
          </code></pre>
          This will print "guess outer inner". The explanation for this is that
          when we invoke the outerFunc function and assigned the returned value
          the innerFunc function to the variable x, the outerParam will have a
          value of outer even though we assign a new value outer-2 to the
          outerVar variable because the reassignment happened after the
          invocation of the outer function and in that time when we invoke the
          outerFunc function it's look up the value of outerVar in the Scope
          Chain, the outerVar will have a value of "outer".<br />
          Now, when we invoke the x variable which have a reference to the
          innerFunc, the innerParam will have a value of inner because thats the
          value we pass in the invocation and the globalVar variable will have a
          value of guess because before the invocation of the x variable we
          assign a new value to the globalVar and at the time of invocation x
          the value of globalVar in the_Scope Chain_ is guess.
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is debounce?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Debouncing a function ensures that it doesn’t get called too
          frequently. Usually we don't write a custom debounce function and use
          the "lodash" version, which is great Example

        <h3>
          The data types supported by JavaScript are?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
            Undefined
            Null
            Boolean
            String
            Symbol
            Number
            Object
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>
          Explain var, let, const?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or
          const.
          <pre><code>
            var a=10;
            let b=20;
            const PI=3.14;
          </code></pre>
          <i>var:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is
          limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined
          outside any function, the scope of the variable is global. var is
          “function scoped”.<br />
          <i>let:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or
          “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
          “let” and “const” are“block scoped”.<br />
          <i>const:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const”
          is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable
          is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned. “const” cannot
          be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
        </div>

        <h3>
          What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          === and !== are strict comparison operators: <br />

          JavaScript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison.
          For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type
          and:<br />

          Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of
          characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding
          positions.<br />
          Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have
          the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
          Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.<br />
          Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are
          false.<br />
          Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.<br />
          Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined)
          is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]<br />
          Example:
          <pre><code>
            0 == false   // true
            0 === false  // false, because they are of a different type
            1 == "1"     // true, automatic type conversion for value only
            1 === "1"    // false, because they are of a different type
            null == undefined // true
            null === undefined // false
            '0' == false // true
            '0' === false // false
          </code></pre>

        <h3>What is React?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for
          building user interfaces especially for single page applications.<br />
          It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was
          created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook.<br />
          React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on
          Instagram in 2012.

        <h3>What are the major features of React?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre>
                  <code>
                  The major features of React are:
                      - It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
                      - Supports server-side rendering.
                      - Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
                      - Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for JavaScript XML).
                  Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement() function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.
                  In the example below text inside &lt;h1> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

                      class App extends React.Component {
                          render() {
                              return(
                                &lt;div>
                                  &lt;h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}&lt;/h1>
                                &lt;/div>
                              )
                          }
                      }
              </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>What is the difference between Element and Component?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          - An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on
          the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components.<br />
          - Elements can contain other Elements in their props.<br />
          - Creating a React element is cheap.<br />
          - Once an element is created, it is never mutated.<br />
          - The object representation of React Element would be as follows:<br />
          <pre><code>
                  const element = React.createElement(
                    'div',
                    {id: 'login-btn'},
                    'Login'
                  )
                  - The above React.createElement() function returns an object:

                  {
                    type: 'div',
                    props: {
                      children: 'Login',
                      id: 'login-btn'
                    }
                  }
                  - And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render():
                    &lt;div>Login&lt;/div>

                  - Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways.
                  - It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

                  const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
                  &lt;div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>Login&lt;/div>
                  Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:

                  const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(
                    'div',
                    { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },
                    'Login'
                  )
              </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>How to create components in React?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  - There are two possible ways to create a component.

                  ----------------
                  1. Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component.
                  - Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:

                  function Greeting({ message }) {
                    return &lt;h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}&lt;/h1>

                  }
                  ----------------
                  2. Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component.
                  The above function component can be written as:

                  class Greeting extends React.Component {
                    render() {
                      return &lt;h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}&lt;/h1>
                    }
                  }
              </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class
          component otherwise use function component.<br />
          However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use
          state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available
          in class component right in your function component.
        </div>
        <h3>What are Pure Components?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  React.PureComponent is exactly the same as React.Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate() method for you.
                  When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state.
                  Component on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box.
                  Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.
              </code></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>What is state in React?</h3>
          - State of a component is an object that holds some information that
          may change over the lifetime of the component.<br />
          - We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and
          minimize the number of stateful components.<br />

          - Let's create an user component with message state,
          <pre><code>
                  class User extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)

                          this.state = {
                          message: 'Welcome to React world'
                          }
                      }

                      render() {
                          return (
                          &lt;div>
                              &lt;h1>{this.state.message}&lt;/h1>
                          &lt;/div>
                          )
                      }
                  }
              </code></pre>
          <img src="./images/state.jpg" />

          - State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by
          the component. i.e,<br />
          - It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns
          and sets it.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <h3>What are props in React?</h3>
          Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects
          containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation
          using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are
          data passed down from a parent component to a child component.<br />

          The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following
          component functionality:<br />

          Pass custom data to your component.<br />
          Trigger state changes.<br />
          Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.<br />
          For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:
          <pre><code>
                  &lt;Element reactProp={'1'} />

                  This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.
                  props.reactProp
              </code></pre>
        </div>
        <h3>What is the difference between state and props?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them
          hold information that influences the output of render, they are
          different in their functionality with respect to component.<br />
          Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters
          whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables
          declared within a function.
        </div>

        <h3>Why should we not update the state directly?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component.

                  // Wrong
                  this.state.message = 'Hello world'
                  Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object.
                  When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

                  // Correct
                  this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })
                  Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax

        <h3>
          What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action.

                  Note: It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

                  setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'))

        <h3>What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event
          handling,
          <pre><code>
                      1. In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase:
                          &lt;button onclick='activateLasers()'>
                          - Whereas in React it follows camelCase convention:

                          &lt;button onClick={activateLasers}>

                      2. In HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior:
                          &lt;a href='#' onclick='console.log("The link was clicked."); return false;' />
                          - Whereas in React you must call preventDefault() explicitly:

                          function handleClick(event) {
                          event.preventDefault()
                          console.log('The link was clicked.')
                          }

                      3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending () Whereas in react you should not append () with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)
              </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:
          <pre><code>
                  1. Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

                      class Component extends React.Componenet {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)
                              this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
                          }

                          handleClick() {
                              // ...
                          }
                      }

                  2. Public class fields syntax: If you don't like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks.

                      handleClick = () => {
                          console.log('this is:', this)
                      }
                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}>
                          {'Click me'}
                      &lt;/button>

                  3. Arrow functions in callbacks: You can use arrow functions directly in the callbacks.

                      &lt;button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}>
                          {'Click me'}
                      &lt;/button>
              </code>
          </pre>
          Note: If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those
          components might do an extra re-rendering.<br />
          In those cases, it is preferred to go with .bind() or public class
          fields syntax approach considering performance.
        </div>

        <h3>How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass
          parameters:
          <pre><code>
                      &lt;button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} />
                  This is an equivalent to calling .bind:

                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} />
                  Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as array function

                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} />
                      handleClick = (id) => () => {
                          console.log("Hello, your ticket number is", id)
                      };

        <h3>What are inline conditional expressions?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are
          available from JS to conditionally render expressions.<br />
          Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX
          by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical
          operator &&.
          <pre><code>
                      &lt;h1>Hello!&lt;/h1>
                      {

                          &lt;h2>
                              You have {messages.length} unread messages.
                          &lt;/h2>
                          :
                          &lt;h2>
                              You don't have unread messages.
                          &lt;/h2>

        <h3>
          What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of
          elements?
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating
          arrays of elements.<br />
          Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or
          are removed.<br />
          Most often we use ID from our data as key:
          <pre><code>
                      const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
                      &lt;li key={todo.id}>
                          {todo.text}
                      &lt;/li>
                      )

                  When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

                      const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
                      &lt;li key={index}>
                          {todo.text}
                      &lt;/li>
                      )
              </code></pre>
          Note:<br />
          1. Using indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may
          change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues
          with component state.<br />
          2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on
          list component instead of li tag.<br />
          3. There will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is
          not present on list items.<br />

        <h3>What is the use of refs?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          The ref is used to return a reference to the element.<br />
          They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when
          you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a
          component.
        </div>

        <h3>How to create refs?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          There are two approaches
          <pre><code>
                  1. This is a recently added approach. Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor.

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)
                          this.myRef = React.createRef()
                      }
                      render() {
                          return &lt;div ref={this.myRef} />
                      }
                      }

                  2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element accessed as follows,

                      class SearchBar extends Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props);
                          this.txtSearch = null;
                          this.state = { term: '' };
                          this.setInputSearchRef = e => {
                              this.txtSearch = e;
                          }
                      }
                      onInputChange(event) {
                          this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
                      }
                      render() {
                          return (
                              &lt;input
                                  value={this.state.term}
                                  onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
                                  ref={this.setInputSearchRef} />
                          );
                      }
                      }
                  3. You can also use refs in function components using closures.

        <h3>What are forward refs?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Ref forwarding is a feature that lets some components take a ref they
          receive, and pass it further down to a child.
          <pre><code>
                  const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
                      &lt;button ref={ref} className="CustomButton">
                          {props.children}
                      &lt;/button>
                  ));

                  // Create ref to the DOM button:
                  const ref = React.createRef();
                  &lt;ButtonElement ref={ref}>{'Forward Ref'}&lt;/ButtonElement>

        <h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM.
                  The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.
                  It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.
                  This entire process is called reconciliation.
              </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>How Virtual DOM works?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

          <pre><code>
                      1. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.

                      <img src="./images/vdom1.png"/>

                      2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.

                      <img src="./images/vdom2.png"/>

                      3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.

        <h3>What are controlled components?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called Controlled Component, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

                  For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

                      handleChange(event) {
                      this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

                  In the below UserProfile component, the name input is accessed using ref.

                      class UserProfile extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)

                      }

                      handleSubmit(event) {
                          alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value)
                          event.preventDefault()
                      }

                      render() {
                          return (
                          &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>

                              {'Name:'}
                              &lt;input type="text" ref={this.input} />
                              &lt;/label>
                              &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" />

                      }
                      }

                  In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms.

        <h3>What are the different phases of component lifecycle?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

                      1. Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.

                      2. Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.

                      3. Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.

                  It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

                      1. Render The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

                      2. Pre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().

                      3. Commit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.

                  Before React 16.3

                      componentWillMount: Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
                      componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
                      componentWillReceiveProps: Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
                      shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
                      componentWillUpdate: Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate() which returns true.
                      componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
                      componentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

                  React 16.3+

                      getDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth reading if you need derived state.
                      componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
                      shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
                      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
                      componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
                      componentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

        <h3>What are Higher-Order Components?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
                  Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

                  We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

                      const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)

                  HOC can be used for many use cases:
                      - Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
                      - Render hijacking.
                      - State abstraction and manipulation.

                      const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  Children is a prop (this.prop.children) that allow you to pass components as data to other components,
                  just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.

                  There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop.
                  These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.

                  A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

                  const MyDiv = React.createClass({
                    render: function() {

          What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method
                  has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well.
                  The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props
                  in your child constructors.

                  Passing props:

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)

                              console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }
                      }

                  Not passing props:

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super()

                              console.log(this.props) // prints undefined

                              // but props parameter is still available
                              console.log(props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }

                          render() {
                              // no difference outside constructor
                              console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }
                      }
                  The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor.
                  It would be the same outside the constructor.

        <h3>Is lazy function supports named exports?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  No, currently React.lazy function supports default exports only.
                  If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an
                  intermediate module that reexports it as the default.
                  It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
                  Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,

                  // MoreComponents.js
                      export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
                      export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;

                  and reexport MoreComponents.js components in an intermediate file IntermediateComponent.js

                  // IntermediateComponent.js
                      export { SomeComponent as default } from "./MoreComponents.js";

                  Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,

                      import React, { lazy } from 'react';
                      const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"));

        <h3>Why React uses className over class attribute?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  class is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript.
                  That's the principal reason why React uses className instead of class.
                  Pass a string as the className prop.

                  render() {
                    return &lt;span className={'menu navigation-menu'}>{'Menu'}&lt;/span>

                  It's common pattern in React which is used for a component to return multiple elements.
                  Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

                  render() {
                    return (
                      &lt;React.Fragment>
                          &lt;ChildA />

                    )
                  }
                  There is also a shorter syntax, but it's not supported in many tools:

                  render() {
                    return (

                  Below are the list of reasons,

                      - Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
                      - Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
                      - The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

          <pre><code>
                  Portal is a recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

                      ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)

                  The first argument is any render-able React child, such as an element, string, or fragment.
                  The second argument is a DOM element.

        <h3>What are stateless components?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component.
                  You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components.
                  But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components.
                  There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.

          <pre><code>
                  If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.

                      class App extends Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)
                              this.state = { count: 0 }

        <h3>How to apply validation on props in React?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  When the application is running in development mode,
                  React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have correct type. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in production mode due to performance impact.
                  The mandatory props are defined with isRequired.

                  The set of predefined prop types:

                  PropTypes.number
                  PropTypes.string
                  PropTypes.array
                  PropTypes.object
                  PropTypes.func
                  PropTypes.node
                  PropTypes.element
                  PropTypes.bool
                  PropTypes.symbol
                  PropTypes.any

                  We can define propTypes for User component as below:

                  import React from 'react'
                  import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

                  class User extends React.Component {
                    static propTypes = {
                      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
                      age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
                    }

                    render() {
                      return (
                          &lt;>
                              &lt;h1>{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}&lt;/h1>
                              &lt;h2>{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}&lt;/h2>
                          &lt;/>
                      )
                    }
                  }

                  Note: In React v15.5 PropTypes were moved from React.PropTypes to prop-types library.

        <h3>What are error boundaries in React v16?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree,
                  log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

                  A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError() :

                      class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)

                          }

                          componentDidCatch(error, info) {
                              // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
                              logErrorToMyService(error, info)
                          }

                          static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
                              // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
                              return { hasError: true };
                          }

                          render() {
                              if (this.state.hasError) {
                                  // You can render any custom fallback UI
                                  return &lt;h1>{'Something went wrong.'}&lt;/h1>
                              }
                              return this.props.children
                          }
                      }

                  After that use it as a regular component:

                      &lt;MyWidget />

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:

                      renderToString()
                      renderToStaticMarkup()

                  For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call renderToString to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.

                      // using Express
                      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'

                  The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute is React's replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM. Just like innerHTML, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a __html object as key and HTML text as value.

                  In this example MyComponent uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute for setting HTML markup:

                      function createMarkup() {
                      return { __html: 'First &middot; Second' }

          <pre><code>
                  The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string.
                  This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

                      const divStyle = {
                      color: 'blue',
                      backgroundImage: 'url(' + imgUrl + ')'
                      };

                      function HelloWorldComponent() {
                      return &lt;div style={divStyle}>Hello World!&lt;/div>
                      }

                  Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage).

          Handling events in React elements has some syntactic differences:
          <pre><code>
                      - React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
                      - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

        <h3>What will happen if you use setState() in constructor?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  When you use setState(), then apart from assigning to the object state React also re-renders the component and all its children.
                  You would get error like this: Can only update a mounted or mounting component.
                  So we need to use this.state to initialize variables inside constructor.

        <h3>What is the impact of indexes as keys?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep
          track of elements.
          <pre><code>


                  In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented.
                  This limits the optimizations that React can do.

                      {todos.map((todo, index) =>
                          &lt;Todo
                              {...todo}
                              key={index}
                          />
                      )}

                  If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable,
                  React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

                      {todos.map((todo) =>
                          &lt;Todo {...todo}
                              key={todo.id} />

        <h3>Is it good to use setState() in componentWillMount() method?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  It is recommended to avoid async initialization in componentWillMount() lifecycle
                  method. componentWillMount() is invoked immediately before mounting occurs.
                  It is called before render(), therefore setting state in this method will not trigger
                  a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method.
                  We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in componentDidMount() instead of componentWillMount().

                  componentDidMount() {
                    axios.get(`api/todos`)
                      .then((result) => {
                        this.setState({
                          messages: [...result.data]
                        })
                      })

        <h3>What will happen if you use props in initial state?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          If the props on the component are changed without the component being
          refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the
          constructor function will never update the current state of the
          component.<br />
          The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is
          first created.
          <pre><code>

                  The below component won't display the updated input value:

                  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                    constructor(props) {
                      super(props)

                      this.state = {
                        records: [],
                        inputValue: this.props.inputValue

                    }
                  }

                  Using props inside render method will update the value:

                  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                    constructor(props) {
                      super(props)

        <h3>How do you conditionally render components?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          In some cases you want to render different components depending on
          some state. JSX does not render false or undefined, so you can use
          conditional short-circuiting to render a given part of your component
          only if a certain condition is true.
          <pre><code>


                      const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
                          &lt;div>
                              &lt;h2>{name}&lt;/h2>
                              {address &&
                                  &lt;p>{address}&lt;/p>
                              }
                          &lt;/div>
                      )

                  If you need an if-else condition then use ternary operator.

                      const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
                          &lt;div>

                              : &lt;p>{'Address is not available'}&lt;/p>
                              }

        <h3>Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  When we spread props we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice.
                  Instead we can use prop destructuring with ...rest operator, so it will add only required props.

                  For example,

                      const ComponentA = () =>
                          &lt;ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={'componentStyle'} />

                      const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) =>
                          &lt;div {...domProps}>{'ComponentB'}&lt;/div>

        <h3>How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers.
                  A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

                      import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'
                      import App from './App'

                      ReactDOMServer.renderToString(&lt;App />)

                  This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side,
                  React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.

                      # Installation
                      $ npm install -g create-react-app

                      # Create new project

                      - Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
                      - Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
                      - A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
                      - A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
                      - A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

        <h3>Why we need to pass a function to setState()?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The reason behind for this is that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState() since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().

                  Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

                      // assuming this.state.count === 0
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      // this.state.count === 1, not 3

                  If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.

                      this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
                      count: prevState.count + props.increment
                      }))
                      // this.state.count === 3 as expected
                      (OR)

                  Why function is preferred over object for setState()?
                  React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

                  This counter example will fail to update as expected:

                      // Wrong
                      this.setState({
                      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
                      })
                      The preferred approach is to call setState() with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

                      // Correct
                      this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
                      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
                      }))

        <h3>Why should component names start with capital letter?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

                      class SomeComponent extends Component {
                          // Code goes here
                      }

                      You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

                      class myComponent extends Component {
                          render() {
                              return &lt;div />
                          }
                      }

                  export default myComponent
                  While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

                  import MyComponent from './MyComponent'

                          }
                      }

                  Outside constructor() both will display same value for this.props.

        <h3>How to loop inside JSX?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  You can simply use Array.prototype.map with ES6 arrow function syntax.

                  For example, the items array of objects is mapped into an array of components:

                      &lt;tbody>
                          {items.map(item => &lt;SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />)}
                      &lt;/tbody>

                  But you can't iterate using for loop:

                      &lt;tbody>
                          for (let i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
                              &lt;SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />
                          }
                      &lt;/tbody>


              </code></pre>
          This is because JSX tags are transpiled into function calls, and you
          can't use statements inside expressions.<br />
          This may change thanks to do expressions which are stage 1 proposal.

        <h3>What is React PropType array with shape?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  If you want to pass an array of objects to a component with a particular shape then use React.PropTypes.shape() as an argument to React.PropTypes.arrayOf().

                  ReactComponent.propTypes = {
                    arrayWithShape: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(React.PropTypes.shape({
                      color: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
                      fontSize: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  You shouldn't use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.

                      &lt;div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}">

                  Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don't forget to include spaces between class names):

                      &lt;div className={'btn-panel ' + (this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden')}>
                      Template strings will also work:

                      &lt;div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}`}>

        <div class="answer">

                  The react package contains React.createElement(), React.Component, React.Children, and other
                  helpers related to elements and component classes.
                  You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components.
                  The react-dom package contains ReactDOM.render(), and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with ReactDOMServer.renderToString() and ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup().

        <div class="answer">
          <pre><code>
                  The React philosophy is that props should be immutable and top-down.
                  This means that a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can't modify received props.

          <pre><code>
                  Calling setState() with an object to merge with state:

                      1. Using Object.assign() to create a copy of the object:

                          const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 })
                          this.setState({ user })
                          Using spread operator:

                          const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 }
                          this.setState({ user })

                      2. Calling setState() with a function:

                          this.setState(prevState => ({
                          user: {

        <h3>What are the exceptions on React component naming?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          The component names should start with a uppercase letter but there are
          few exceptions on this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot
          (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.

          <pre><code>

                  For example the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

                  render(){
                     return (
                          &lt;obj.component /> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`

        <h3>Why is a component constructor called only once?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          React's reconciliation algorithm assumes that without any information
          to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on
          subsequent renders, it's the same component as before, so reuses the
          previous instance rather than creating a new one.

        <h3>How to programmatically trigger click event in React?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying
          HTMLInputElement object through a callback, store the reference as a
          class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from
          your event handlers using the HTMLElement.click method.<br />

          This can be done in two steps:
          <pre><code>

                  1. Create ref in render method:

                      &lt;input ref={input => this.inputElement = input} />

                  2. Apply click event in your event handler:

                      this.inputElement.click()

        <h3>What is the benefit of styles modules?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          It is recommended to avoid hard coding style values in components.<br />
          Any values that are likely to be used across different UI components
          should be extracted into their own modules.<br />

          For example, these styles could be extracted into a separate
          component:
          <pre><code>
                      export const colors = {
                          white,
                          black,
                          blue
                      }

                      export const space = [
                          0,
                          8,
                          16,
                          32,
                          64
                      ]

                  And then imported individually in other components:

                      import { space, colors } from './styles'

        </div>

        <h3>What are the popular React-specific linters?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available
          that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is
          an npm package called eslint-plugin-react.<br />
          By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules
          checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop
          types.<br />

          Another popular plugin is eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, which will help fix
          common issues with accessibility.<br />
          As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with
          alt text and tabindex, for example, will not be picked up by regular
          plugins.

        <h3>What are render props?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          Render Props is a simple technique for sharing code between components
          using a prop whose value is a function.<br />
          The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.
          <pre><code>
                      &lt;DataProvider render={data => (
                          &lt;h1>{`Hello ${data.target}`}&lt;/h1>
                      )}/>
              </code></pre>
          Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern.
